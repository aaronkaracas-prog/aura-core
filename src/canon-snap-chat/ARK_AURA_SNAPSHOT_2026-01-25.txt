SNAPSHOT CAPSULE — ARK SYSTEMS / AURA
Date: 2026-01-25
Purpose: Clean resume point with NO repetition.

=== WHAT IS SOLVED (DO NOT REPEAT) ===
- Cloudflare Workers routes for:
  - frontdesk.network/*
  - www.frontdesk.network/*
  → both correctly point to aura-core
- SSL is resolved.
- /health works on:
  - frontdesk.network
  - www.frontdesk.network
- Wrangler OAuth login is confirmed working (NOT token-based).
- KV, R2, Services bindings are correct and already present.
- PowerShell + Wrangler deploy pipeline is proven.

=== WHAT WENT WRONG (ROOT CAUSE) ===
- Aura can STORE intent/config (Canon, modes),
  but aura-core does NOT yet EXECUTE host-specific behavior from KV.
- Because of this, every content change forced a redeploy.
- This created the illusion that infra/tokens/routes were broken.
- They are NOT broken.

=== WHAT WE ARE BUILDING NEXT (ONE THING ONLY) ===
A KV-driven HOST PROFILE layer.

Definition:
- KV key pattern: SITE:<host>
  Examples:
    SITE:frontdesk.network
    SITE:cityguide.world
    SITE:arksystems.us

Behavior:
- aura-core reads request.headers.host
- Loads SITE:<host> from KV
- Renders landing + human /health from KV
- NO redeploy for content changes

=== CURRENT OBJECTIVE ===
Implement Host Profile execution in src/index.js.

=== WHAT AARON WILL PROVIDE IN NEW SESSION ===
1) Paste:
   RECALL_CANON:ARKSYSTEMS_CURRENT_REALITY

2) Upload file:
   C:\Users\Aaron Karacas\aura-worker\aura\src\index.js

=== WHAT THE NEXT SESSION MUST DO (NO DISCUSSION) ===
- Generate a FULL FILE replacement src/index.js
- Add Host Profile resolver using KV (AURA_KV)
- Dual-mode /health:
  - Browser → human page (from KV)
  - Script → JSON (unchanged)
- / route renders from SITE:<host>
- Provide Aura commands to:
  - SET_SITE_PROFILE frontdesk.network {...}

=== NON-NEGOTIABLE RULES ===
- No redoing routes
- No token changes
- No infra explanations
- Full-file replacement only
- Minimal text, maximum execution

=== ONE-SENTENCE TRUTH ===
Infra is done. Memory is done. The only missing piece is execution from KV.

END SNAPSHOT
