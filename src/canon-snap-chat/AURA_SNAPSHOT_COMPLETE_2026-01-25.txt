AURA SNAPSHOT — COMPLETE CONTEXT (DO NOT RE-LITIGATE)

Purpose:
This snapshot is a full, authoritative context handoff. Everything needed to understand the system, current state, and how to proceed is contained here. No reconstruction, no backtracking.

Operator:
Aaron Karacas

System:
Aura — Cloudflare Worker (aura-core)

Current Live Build:
AURA_CORE__2026-01-25__AUTONOMY_STEP_111__FRONTDESK_ONESTEP__CF_CHAT_WIRING__01

Status:
LIVE, OPERATIONAL, UI WIRED (mic + uploads enabled)

------------------------------------
CORE REALITY (PROVEN, LOCKED)
------------------------------------

1) Aura Core
- aura-core deploys cleanly
- /health returns correct build marker
- /ui renders Chat-style interface
- KV, R2, Deployer, CF bindings present
- Aura is the active control plane

2) Domains
- auras.guide: stable UI + verification surface
- cityguide.world: previously launched, proves end-to-end model
- arksystems.us:
  - Nameservers: yichun.ns.cloudflare.com, zoe.ns.cloudflare.com
  - Routes:
    - arksystems.us/* → aura-core
    - www.arksystems.us/* → aura-core
  - Root / is KV-backed (not redirect)
  - Landing renders with /ui and /health buttons
  - Verified LIVE previously via curl --resolve
  - DONE. Not under active work.

------------------------------------
CANON SYSTEM (CRITICAL)
------------------------------------

Aura now has a working Canon system:
- Canon stored in KV
- Human-readable
- Recallable inline
- Persistent across sessions

Working commands:
- CANON_PUT:<alias>
- RECALL_CANON:<alias>
- CANON_LIST

Primary Living Canon (ACTIVE):
Alias: ARKSYSTEMS_CURRENT_REALITY

This Canon contains:
- All proven milestones
- Exact current development state
- Rules for how work proceeds
- It is authoritative and continuously updated

If confusion occurs:
RECALL_CANON:ARKSYSTEMS_CURRENT_REALITY
This overrides session memory and summaries.

------------------------------------
CURRENT DEVELOPMENT STATE (RIGHT NOW)
------------------------------------

Active work is NOT:
- arksystems.us
- cityguide.world

Active work IS:
- Making Aura lossless across time
- Preventing solved problems from reappearing
- Using Canon as the permanent memory layer
- Preparing to Canon-lock FrontDesk.Network one-step autonomy

Recent change:
- Canon recall/export was missing
- Code updated
- Canon is now visible and verifiable

------------------------------------
RULES FOR CONTINUATION
------------------------------------

- Do not re-litigate solved domains
- Do not redo setup work
- Proceed forward only
- Update the Living Canon as state changes
- Future sessions must ask for Canon recall, not summaries

------------------------------------
NEXT EXPECTED ACTION
------------------------------------

Aaron will upload the current index.js next.
After that, work resumes on FrontDesk.Network one-step autonomy.

END SNAPSHOT
