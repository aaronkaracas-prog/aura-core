NORTH STAR — KERNEL FOCUS FOR CHATGPT SESSIONS

Purpose:
This document exists ONLY to keep ChatGPT aligned and prevent drift.
It is not Aura doctrine. It is not history. It is not training data.
It is a session anchor.

READ THIS FIRST IN ANY NEW SESSION.

--------------------------------------------------
CURRENT STATE (FACTUAL)
--------------------------------------------------
- Aura-core is running and working.
- UI is locked. DO NOT change UI.
- Front page / landing page work is DONE.
- Memory features are not the focus right now.
- index.js currently deployed is known-good.

--------------------------------------------------
SCOPE LOCK (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
--------------------------------------------------
ONLY WORK ON THE FOLLOWING, IN ORDER:

A) Kernel Doctrine
   - Treat aura-core (index.js) as a kernel.
   - No autonomous self-editing of core in production.
   - Core changes are rare, deliberate, reversible.

B) Safe Deploy Doctrine
   - Staging -> verify -> promote -> rollback.
   - No direct blind prod deploys.

C) Invariants
   - /ui must always work.
   - /health must always return build marker.
   - Canon recall must always function.
   - ENSURE_DOMAIN_READY remains mandatory.

D) Break-Glass Recovery
   - Maintain last-known-good index.js.
   - One clear manual redeploy path.
   - If uncertain, revert immediately.

--------------------------------------------------
EXPLICIT DO-NOTS
--------------------------------------------------
- DO NOT propose front page or landing page work.
- DO NOT redesign or tweak UI.
- DO NOT revisit already-solved problems.
- DO NOT introduce new product ideas.
- DO NOT talk about Aura memory unless explicitly asked.

--------------------------------------------------
HOW TO PROCEED
--------------------------------------------------
- Start with A) Kernel Doctrine.
- Provide concrete, minimal steps.
- Prefer policy + guardrails before code.
- Only touch index.js if absolutely necessary.
- Use full-file replacement only when required.

--------------------------------------------------
OPERATOR INSTRUCTION
--------------------------------------------------
If Aaron says:
"Let's move forward"
or
"Continue"

You should respond with:
"We are working on A) Kernel Doctrine. Here is the next step."
