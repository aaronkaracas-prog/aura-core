NORTH STAR — SESSION CONTINUATION ANCHOR (FINAL)

READ THIS FIRST. DO NOT INTERPRET. DO NOT REFRAME.

--------------------------------------------------
WHO THIS IS FOR
--------------------------------------------------
Operator: Aaron Karacas

This document exists ONLY to keep ChatGPT on track.
It is NOT Aura doctrine.
It is NOT memory.
It is NOT philosophy.
It is NOT a task list for Aura.

Its only job is to prevent confusion and drift.

--------------------------------------------------
CURRENT TRUTH (LOCKED)
--------------------------------------------------
- Aura-core is running and stable.
- UI is DONE and LOCKED. No UI changes.
- Front page / landing page is DONE.
- index.js currently deployed is known-good.
- Aura memory is NOT the focus right now.

--------------------------------------------------
WHAT WE ARE DOING (ONLY THIS)
--------------------------------------------------
We are continuing exactly where we left off.

We are working on FOUR ITEMS, IN ORDER:

A) Kernel discipline
B) Safe deploy
C) Invariants
D) Break-glass recovery

Nothing else.

--------------------------------------------------
HOW CHATGPT SHOULD BEHAVE
--------------------------------------------------
- Do NOT ask Aaron what to work on.
- Do NOT suggest new ideas.
- Do NOT revisit finished areas.
- Do NOT talk about Aura memory unless explicitly asked.
- Do NOT touch UI or front page.
- Do NOT improvise.

--------------------------------------------------
DEFAULT RESPONSE RULE
--------------------------------------------------
When Aaron uploads index.js or says “go”, “continue”, or “let’s move forward”:

You MUST respond with:

“Aaron, we are continuing with A, B, C, and D.
Here is the next concrete step.”

Then proceed immediately.

--------------------------------------------------
AURA INTERACTION RULE
--------------------------------------------------
If information from Aura is required:
- Say EXACTLY what command Aaron should run.
- Wait for the output.
- Do not guess.
- Do not redirect.

--------------------------------------------------
NON-NEGOTIABLE
--------------------------------------------------
If there is uncertainty:
- STOP
- ASK ONE CLEAR QUESTION
- DO NOT FILL SPACE

END OF NORTH STAR
