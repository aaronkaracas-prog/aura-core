NORTH STAR — SESSION CONTINUATION ANCHOR (FULL) — CURRENT OBJECTIVES AND SYSTEM STATUS

READ THIS FIRST IN ANY NEW SESSION.

--------------------------------------------------
WHO THIS IS FOR
--------------------------------------------------
Operator: Aaron Karacas

This document exists ONLY to keep ChatGPT on track.
It is **NOT** Aura doctrine.
It is **NOT** memory.
It is **NOT** philosophy.
It is **NOT** a task list for Aura.

Its only job is to prevent confusion and drift.

--------------------------------------------------
CURRENT TRUTH (LOCKED)
--------------------------------------------------
- Aura-core is running and stable.
- UI is locked. **No UI changes.**
- Front page / landing page is **done**.
- **index.js** currently deployed is known-good.
- Aura **memory** is not the primary focus right now.

--------------------------------------------------
WHAT WE ARE DOING (ONLY THIS)
--------------------------------------------------
We are continuing exactly where we left off.

We are working on FOUR ITEMS, IN ORDER:

A) Kernel discipline (ensure index.js is the clean kernel)
B) Safe deploy (ensure deployment process is verified, staged, and stable)
C) Invariants (keep `/ui`, `/health`, and `CANON` steady)
D) Break-glass recovery (ensure fallback options and ability to reset)

**Nothing else.**

--------------------------------------------------
HOW CHATGPT SHOULD BEHAVE
--------------------------------------------------
- Do **NOT** ask Aaron what to work on.
- Do **NOT** suggest new ideas.
- Do **NOT** revisit finished areas.
- Do **NOT** talk about Aura memory unless explicitly asked.
- Do **NOT** improvise.

--------------------------------------------------
DEFAULT RESPONSE RULE
--------------------------------------------------
When Aaron uploads index.js or says **“go”**, **“continue”**, or **“let’s move forward”**:

You MUST respond with:
> “Aaron, we are continuing with A, B, C, and D.  
> Here is the next concrete step.”

Then proceed immediately.

--------------------------------------------------
AURA INTERACTION RULE
--------------------------------------------------
If information from Aura is required:
- Say **EXACTLY** what command Aaron should run.
- Wait for the output.
- Do **NOT** guess.
- Do **NOT** redirect.

--------------------------------------------------
SCOPE LOCK (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
--------------------------------------------------
The following are **locked** until completion:

1. **Kernel Discipline**: Ensure Aura-core (index.js) is treated as a stable kernel.
2. **Safe Deploy**: Staging, verification, promotion, and rollback are confirmed working.
3. **Invariants**: The core functionality of `/ui`, `/health`, and Canon are preserved.
4. **Break-Glass Recovery**: The deployment process allows rollback and resets.

DO NOT propose work on other objectives (e.g., Front Page, UI changes, new ideas, etc.).

--------------------------------------------------
CURRENT STATE
--------------------------------------------------
- **aistatus.world**: Currently **not launched**. DNS and Cloudflare zone confirmed, but missing worker route and bindings.
- **Previous work**: **Launch of arksystems.us** and **cityguide.world** confirmed.
- **Memory behavior**: Aura can **remember history** but doesn’t yet **automatically retrieve relevant facts** without explicit recall.

--------------------------------------------------
NEXT ACTION PLAN
--------------------------------------------------
1. **Verify Aura’s memory recall system**: Ensure Aura automatically recalls relevant context when needed (e.g., restaurant address).
2. **Deploy another site**: Start by launching a new site (`aistatus.world`), ensuring all components are connected (DNS, Cloudflare, worker routes).
3. **Fix retrieval failure**: Aura must retrieve data on its own without being reminded every time.

--------------------------------------------------
NON-NEGOTIABLE: HOW TO PROCEED
--------------------------------------------------
When you open a **new ChatGPT session**, do this **in this order**:

1. **Upload this North Star file**.
2. **Upload the latest index.js file** (known good).
3. Type **one word**:
   ```
   go
   ```

This will force Aura to continue from **A, B, C, D** without any distractions, redirection, or unnecessary clarification.

After this, you can provide specific instructions like:

1. **Verify `aistatus.world` live status**.
2. **Continue with the next deploy step** for `aistatus.world`.

DO NOT:

- Give new objectives or change existing ones (e.g., Front page, UI changes).
- Touch any new product ideas.
- Ask Aura to remember things without explicit recall instructions.

--------------------------------------------------
THE CURRENT STATE IS LOCKED.
--------------------------------------------------
The focus is on **continuation**. No deviations. No rework. No unnecessary feedback.

End of North Star.
